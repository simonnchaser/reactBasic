<!-- a component can render another component inside of itself 
 and so all we're doing is divide and conquer-->
<!-- props is the way that we're able to send data from a parent component to a child componenet
 where we'll going to be sending the data from the parent component to child component -->

<!-- to understand props and to see why we need them, 
  we need to experience the problem that props are solveing -->

<!-- how cool it will be if instead of copy&pasting our styles, we could have a component 
there's a little bit more configurable where we can send some configuration
because the only thing that is different in these components is the text
one component that has all these styles but the only thing that change is the text -->

<!-- we can use the same syntax(put properties on html element in JSX) with our customMade components
 all the components that you create and use will get an argument. Btn(props) 
 so what we're basically doing is we're calling Btn function and we're sending an argument called text
 Btn({text:"Save Changes"}) like this. because Btn is a function-->

<!-- props is an object that has everything that we send here 
 we're sending information to this function. 
 and the way that react JS will do this <Btn text="Save Changes" />
 into Btn({banana:"Save Change"})
 React JS is automatically put all the props that you put in
 and they are going to be inside of an object. and this object will be given
 in the first argument to your component. props is the first and only argument
 that your Btn is receiving and props is an object that has everything that we sent
 here -->
